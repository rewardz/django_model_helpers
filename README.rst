**Model helpers** are small collection of django functions and classes that make working with models easier.
All functions here are compliant with pylint and has test cases with over 95% code coverage.
This doc describe each of these helpers.

upload_to_
  Pass this function to your `FileField` as `upload_to` argument

cached_model_property_
  Decorate a model function with that decorator to turn it into a property that caches the result.

cached_function_
  Decorate any function or class method with that decorator to enable out of the box caching.

Choices_
  A feature rich solution for implementing choice field

KeyValueField_
  A field that can store multiple key/value entries in a human readable form

.. _upload_to:

**model\_helpers.upload\_to**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass ``model_helpers.upload_to`` as ``upload_to`` parameter for any FileField or ImageField. This will - by default - generate slugified version of the file name. By default each model get its own storage folder named after model's name.

``upload_to`` function also block files with certain harmful extensions like "php" or "py" from being uploaded.

**Sample usage:**

::

    import model_helpers

    class Profile(models.model):
        name = CharField(max_length=100)
        picture = ImageField(upload_to=model_helpers.upload_to)

uploaded images for this model will be stored in: ``media/Profile/<current_year>/<slugified_original_filename>``.

**settings**

settings for ``upload_to`` function should be placed in ``UPLOAD_TO_OPTIONS`` inside your *settings.py* file These are the default settings

::

    settings.UPLOAD_TO_OPTIONS = {
        "black_listed_extensions": ["php", "html", "htm", "js", "vbs", "py", "pyc", "asp", "aspx", "pl"],
        "max_filename_length": 40,
        "file_name_template": "{model_name}/%Y/{filename}.{extension}"
    }

-  ``black_listed_extensions`` prevent any file with any of these extensions from being saved.
-  ``max_filename_length`` trim filename if it exceeds certain length to mitigate DB errors when user upload long filename
-  ``file_name_template`` controls where the file should be saved.

**specifying ``file_name_template``**

``file_name_template`` pass your string to strftime() function; ``'%Y'`` in the example above is the four-digit year. other accepted variables are:

-  ``model_name``: name of the model which the file is being uploaded for.
-  ``filename``: name of the file - without extension - after it has been processed by ``upload_to`` (trimmed and slugified)
-  ``extension``: file's extension
-  ``instance``: the model instance passed to ``upload_to`` function

For example to save uploaded files to a directory like this

::

      model name/current year/current month/instance's name(dot)file's extension

you do

::

      UPLOAD_TO_OPTIONS = {"file_name_template": "{model_name}/%Y/%m/{instance.name}.{extension}" }

**customizing ``upload_to`` per model**

If you want to have different ``upload_to`` options for different models, use ``UploadTo`` class instead. For example to have ``ImageField`` that allow all file extensions, You can do this:

::

    my_image = models.ImageField(upload_to=models_helper.UploadTo(black_listed_extensions=[])

``UploadTo`` class accepts all ``upload_to`` settings documented above. You can also inherit from this class if you want to have very custom file naming schema (like if you want file name be based on its md5sum)

.. _cached_model_property:

cached_model_property decorator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``cached_model_property`` is a decorator for model functions that takes no arguments. The decorator convert the function into a property that support caching out of the box

**Note**: ``cached_model_property`` is totally different from django's ``cached_property`` the later is not true caching but rather memorizing function's return value.

**Sample usage:**

::

    class Team(models.Model):
        @cached_model_property
        def points(self):
            # Do complex DB queries
            return result

        @cached_model_property(readonly=False)
        def editable_points(self):
            # get result
            return result

        @cached_model_property(cache_timeout=1)
        def one_second_cache(self):
            # get result
            return result

Now try

::

    team = Team.objects.first()

-  ``team.points`` <-- complex DB queries will happen, result will be returned
-  ``team.points`` <-- this time result is returned from cache (points function is not called
-  ``del team.points`` <-- points value has been removed from cache
-  ``team.points`` <-- complex DB queries will happen, result will be returned

**How does it work?**: first time the decorator store the function output in the cache with ``key = "<model_class>_<instance.pk>_<function_name>"`` so if you have two models with same name, or have model that provide no primary key you can't use this decorator.

set ``readonly`` parameter to ``False`` to make the property writeable

``team.editable_points = 88``

In this case the assigned value will replace the value stored in the cache

``team.editable_points`` returns 88

I personally don't use the writable cached property option but might be useful to someone else

.. _cached_function:

cached_function decorator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``cached_function`` is a decorator for any functions.
The decorator automatically cache function's result for a defined amount of time.
The caching takes into account function arguments and *- for class methods -* class properties.

**Sample Usage:**

::

    class ExampleClass:

        example_field = 0

        @cached_function(cache_timeout=1, key_parameters=["arg_a", "arg_b"], key_class_attrs=["example_field"])
        def example_function(self, arg_a, arg_b, print_result=False):
            if print_result:
                print("Result is ", arg_a + arg_b)
            return arg_a + arg_b

This output from ``example_function`` will be cached for exactly `1` second.
The cache would depend on value of function's ``arg_a`` and ``arg_b`` parameters and class's ``example_field`` value.

.. _Choices:

Choices class (inspired by `Django Choices <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-choices/>`_. )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dealing with Django's ``choices`` attribute is a pain. Here is a proper way of implementing choice field in Django

::

    class Student(models.Model):
        FRESHMAN = 'FR'
        SOPHOMORE = 'SO'
        JUNIOR = 'JR'
        SENIOR = 'SR'
        YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = (
            (FRESHMAN, 'Freshman'),
            (SOPHOMORE, 'Sophomore'),
            (JUNIOR, 'Junior'),
            (SENIOR, 'Senior'),
        )
        year_in_school = models.CharField(
                            max_length=2,
                            choices=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES,
                            default=FRESHMAN)

Then you can do

::

    student = Student.objects.first()
    if student.year_in_school == Student.SENIOR:
          # do some senior stuff

With Choices class this becomes

::

    YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = Choices({
        "freshman": "FR",
        "sophomore": "SO",
        "junior": "JR",
        "Senior": "SR"
    })


    class Student(models.Model):
        year_in_school = models.CharField(
                            max_length=2,
                            choices=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES(),
                            default=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES.freshman)

Then you can do

::

    student = Student.objects.first()
    if student.year_in_school == YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES.senior:
          # do some senior stuff

``YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES`` is a readonly OrderedDict and you can treat it as such. for example: ``YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES.keys()`` or ``YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES.iteritems()``

``Choices`` class is more flexible because it allow you to specify 3 values. choice name, choice db value, choice display name. The example above can be better written like that

::

     YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = Choices({
         "freshman": {"id": 0, "display": "New comer"},
         "sophomore": 1,
         "junior": 2,
         "Senior": 3
      }, order_by="id")


    class Student(models.Model):
        year_in_school = models.SmalllIntegerField(
                            choices=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES(),
                            default=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES.freshman)

Then you can do something like this

::

    Student.objects.filter(
        year_in_school__gt=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES.sophomore)

To return all students in grades higher than Sophomore

-  A choice can be defined as key/value ``"sophomore": 1`` in which case display name will be code name capitalized ``"Sophomore"`` and will be saved in DB as number ``1``
-  A choice can be fully defined as key/dict ``"freshman": {"id": 0, "display": "New comer"}`` in which case display name will be ``"New comer"`` and id will be ``0``

Defining extra keys to use in your code.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned before ``Choices`` can be treated as an OrderedDictionary and so you should feel free to use the free functionality, for example adding extra keys

::

        AVAILABLE_SETTINGS = Choices({
            "max_page_width": {"id": 0, "display": "Maximum page width in pixels", "default": 100})

then in your code you can do

::

    settings = Settings.objects.filter(name=AVAILABLE_SETTINGS.max_page_width).first()
    if settings:
        return settings.value
    return AVAILABLE_SETTINGS["max_page_width"]["default"]

Ordering your ``Choices``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming you have a big list of choices you might prefer to ask Choices class to order them for you.

**Example:**

::

    Choices({
         "usa": {"display": "United States", "id": 0},
         "egypt": 1,
         "uk": {"display": "United Kingdom", "id": 2},
         "ua": {"display": "Ukraine", "id": 3}
        }, order_by="display")

The fields will be in the order "Egypt", "Ukraine", "United Kingdom", "United States".

``order_by="id"`` will order the list by id

If you don't want any sort of ordering then set ``order_by=None`` and in this case its better that you pass your choices as tuple of dictionaries to maintain order

::

    Choices((
         ("uk", {"display": "United Kingdom", "id": 2),
         ("usa", {"display": "United States", "id": 0),
         ("egypt", 1),
         ("ua": {"display": "Ukraine", "id": 3})
        ), order_by=None)

**Note:** By default choices are ordered by display name

Useful functions of ``Choices`` class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``get_display_name``: given choice id, return the display name of that id. same as model's ``get_<field_name>_display()``
-  ``get_code_name``: Given choice id same as ``get_display_name`` but return code name
-  ``get_value``: Given choice id, return value of any key defined inside choice entry

**Example:**

::

    CHOICES_EXAMPLE = Choices({"my_key": {"id": 0, "display": "Display Of My Key", "additional_key": 1234})
    >>> CHOICES_EXAMPLE.get_display_name(0)
    "Display Of My Key"
    >>> CHOICES_EXAMPLE.get_code_name(0)
    "my_key"
    >>> CHOICES_EXAMPLE.get_value(0, "additional_key")
    1234

.. _KeyValueField:

**model\_helpers.KeyValueField**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you need to have a simple key/value field. most developers would rely on ``JsonField`` which is good for some use cases but people using django admin may not like to modify json object that look like this

::

    {"key1": "value of some sort", "key2": "value containing \" character"}

``KeyValueField`` serialize objects in a more readable way. the dictionary above would be stored and displayed like this.

::

    key1 = value of some sort
    key2 = value containing " character

That's it. For you as a developer you will access your ``KeyValueField`` as a dictionary.

**Example**:

::

    class MyModel(models.Model):
         options = KeyValueField(separator=":")

    >> my_model.options = "key1 : val1 \n key2 : val2"
    >> my_model.options
    {"key1": "val1", "key2": "val2"}
    >>> str(my_model.options)
    "key1 : val1 \n key2 : val2"

You can find more examples in the test file ``tests/test_key_value_field.py``

**``KeyValueField`` is NOT good for:**

-  Maintain original value's datatype. all values are converted to unicode strings
-  Store a multiline value
